# Visualize Collision of Molecules

The above scripts have been implemented in:<br>
https://glowscript.org/#/user/apoorv.20cyz0021/folder/Collision/

The same can be run in Jupyter Notebook / Other Web-Based Python Visualizer

The collision coordinates (variables) like R/θ/ϕ can be modified as needed! 

For 4D collision, the modified codes for visualizing various (restricted) coordinates are already available in:<br>

The codes for the same are available in 4D_RR_RR folder
